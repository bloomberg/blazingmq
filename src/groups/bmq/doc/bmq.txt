@PURPOSE: Public SDK API for the BlazingMQ framework.

@MNEMONIC: BlazingMQ (bmq)

@DESCRIPTION: BlazingmQ (package group 'bmq') is a message-queue
 framework allowing application developers to use reliable distributed queues.

 The 'bmqa' and 'bmqt' packages contain all components that constitute the
 public API for BlazingmQ users to use.  A client should only use the
 components in these packages, and should not use any other package under the
 'bmq' package group since they are implementation components that may change
 at any time.
