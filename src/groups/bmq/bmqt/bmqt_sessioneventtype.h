/// @brief Provide an enumeration for the different types of session events.
///
/// @bbref{bmqt::SessionEventType} is an enumeration for the different types of
/// session events.
///
///   - *CONNECTED*: The connection with the broker is established, this event
///     is only fired once (if for any reason the connection gets lost and
///     automatically reconnected, this will emit a `CONNECTION_RESTORED`
///     event).
///
///   - *DISCONNECTED*: The connection with the broker is terminated (after the
///     user called stop on the session). This is the last event that will be
///     delivered.
///
///   - *CONNECTION_LOST*: The session was connected to the broker, but that
///     connection dropped.
///
///   - *RECONNECTED*: The connection to the broker has been re-established.
///     This event is followed by zero or more `QUEUE_REOPEN_RESULT` events,
///     and one `STATE_RESTORED` event.
///
///   - *STATE_RESTORED*: Session's state has been restored after connection
///     has been re-established with the broker. This event is preceded by one
///     `RECONNECTED` event, and zero or more `QUEUE_REOPEN_RESULT` events.
///
///   - *CONNECTION_TIMEOUT*: The connection to the broker has timedout.
///
///   - *QUEUE_OPEN_RESULT*: Indicates the result of an `openQueue` operation.
///
///   - *QUEUE_REOPEN_RESULT*: Indicates the result of an `openQueue`
///     operation, which happens when the connection to the broker has been
///     restored and queues previously opened have been automatically reopened.
///     This event is preceded by a `RECONNECTED` event and followed by zero or
///     more `QUEUE_REOPEN_RESULT` events, and one `STATE_RESTORED` event.
///
///   - *QUEUE_CLOSE_RESULT*: Indicates the result of a `closeQueue` operation.
///
///   - *SLOWCONSUMER_NORMAL*: Notifies that the `EventQueue` is back to its
///     low watermark level.
///
///   - *SLOWCONSUMER_HIGHWATERMARK*: Notifies that events are accumulating in
///     the `EventQueue`, which has now reached it's high watermark level.
///
///   - *QUEUE_CONFIGURE_RESULT*: Indicates the result of a `configureQueue`
///     operation.
///
///   - *HOST_UNHEALTHY*: Indicates the host has become unhealthy. Only issued
///     if a @bbref{bmqpi::HostHealthMonitor} has been installed to the
///     session, via the @bbref{bmqt::SessionOptions} object.
///
///   - *HOST_HEALTH_RESTORED*: Indicates the health of the host has restored,
///     and all queues have resumed operation. Following a Host Health
///     incident, this indicates that the application has resumed normal
///     operation.
///
///   - *QUEUE_SUSPENDED*: Indicates that an open queue has suspended
///     operation:
///
///       * Consumers are configured to receive no more messages from broker
///         (i.e., `maxUnconfirmedMessages` := 0, `maxUnconfirmedBytes` := 0,
///         `consumerPriority` := `INT_MIN`).
///
///       * Attempts to pack messages targeting queue will be rejected by
///         @bbref{bmqa::MessageEventBuilder::packMessage}'. Clients may still
///         attempt to POST existing packed events.
///
///       * Attempts by client to reconfigure queue will not take effect until
///         the queue has resumed.
///
///   - *QUEUE_RESUMED*: Indicates that a suspended queue has resumed normal
///     operation (i.e., effects of `QUEUE_SUSPENDED` state no longer apply).
///
///   - *ERROR*: Indicates a generic error.
///
///   - *TIMEOUT* Indicates that the specified operation has timed out.
///
///   - *CANCELED*: Indicates that the specified operation was canceled.
