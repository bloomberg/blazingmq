/// @file bmqa_session.h
///
/// @brief Provide access to the BlazingMQ broker.
///
/// This component provides a mechanism, @bbref{bmqa::Session}, that provides
/// access to a message queue broker and an interface,
/// @bbref{bmqa::SessionEventHandler} for asynchronous notification of events.
/// The broker manages named, persistent queues of messages.  This broker
/// allows a client to open queues, post messages to them, or retrieve messages
/// from them.  All of these operations take place within the context of the
/// session opened by the client application.
///
/// Messages received from a broker are communicated to the application by the
/// session associated with that broker in the form of events (see @ref
/// bmqa_event.h).  Events can be of two different types: (1) Messages and
/// message status events (@bbref{bmqa::MessageEvent}), or (2) Session or queue
/// status events (@bbref{bmqa::SessionEvent}).
///
/// A @bbref{bmqa::Session} can dispatch events to the application in either a
/// synchronous or asynchronous mode.  In synchronous mode, the application
/// must call the `nextEvent` method in order to obtain events from the
/// @bbref{bmqa::Session}.  In asynchronous mode, the application must supply a
/// concrete @bbref{bmqa::SessionEventHandler} object at construction time.
/// The concrete @bbref{bmqa::SessionEventHandler} provided by the application
/// must implement the `onSessionEvent` and `onMessageEvent` methods, which
/// will be called by the @bbref{bmqa::Session} every time a session event or a
/// message event is received.  Note that by default, a session created in
/// asynchronous mode creates only one internal thread to dispatch events, but
/// a different value for number of threads can be specified in
/// @bbref{bmqt::SessionOptions}.
///
/// A @bbref{bmqa::Session} is created either in synchronous or in asynchronous
/// mode, and it will remain in that mode until destruction.  Allowing a mix
/// between synchronous or asynchronous would make the SDK complicated.  The
/// only exceptions are the "start" and "open" operations that must be
/// available in synchronous or asynchronous version for the convenience of the
/// programmer.
///
/// By default a @bbref{bmqa::Session} connects to the local broker, which in
/// turn may connect to a remote cluster based on configuration.
///
/// After a @bbref{bmqa::Session} is started, the application has to open one
/// or several queues in read and/or write mode.
///
/// Disclaimer                                       {#bmqa_session_disclaimer}
/// ==========
///
/// A @bbref{bmqa::Session} object is a heavy object representing the
/// negotiated TCP session with the broker, and the entire associated state
/// (opened queues, statistics, ...).  Therefore, sessions should be always
/// reused if possible, preferably with only *one* session per lifetime of a
/// component/library/task.  Note that at the time of this writing multiplexing
/// of different logical sessions over the same physical connection is not
/// supported, so in certain circumstances reuse of the same session across the
/// whole of a single application will not be possible. For example, if an
/// application uses two unrelated libraries both of which use BlazingMQ under
/// the hood, they won't be able to share a session as it stands.  An example
/// of an extreme inefficiency and an abuse of resources is to create a session
/// ad-hoc every time a message needs to be posted by the same component.
///
/// Thread-safety                                        {#bmqa_session_thread}
/// =============
///
/// This session object is *thread* *enabled*, meaning that two threads can
/// safely call any methods on the *same* *instance* without external
/// synchronization.
///
/// Connecting to the Broker                         {#bmqa_session_connecting}
/// ========================
///
/// A @bbref{bmqa::Session} establishes a communication with a broker service
/// using TCP/IP.  Each @bbref{bmqa::Session} object must be constructed with a
/// @bbref{bmqt::SessionOptions} object, which provides the necessary
/// information to connect to the broker.  In particular, the
/// @bbref{bmqt::SessionOptions} object must specify the IP address and port
/// needed to connect to the broker.  The @bbref{bmqt::SessionOptions} object
/// may also provide extra parameters for tuning the TCP connection behavior
/// (see @ref bmqt_sessionoptions.h for details).
///
/// Note that in most cases the user does not need to explicitly construct a
/// @bbref{bmqt::SessionOptions} object: the default constructor for
/// @bbref{bmqt::SessionOptions} creates an instance that will connect to the
/// broker service on the local machine using the standard port.
///
/// Some options can also be provided using environment variables.
///
///   - **BMQ_BROKER_URI**: Corresponds to
///     @bbref{bmqt::SessionOptions::brokerUri}.  If this environment variable
///     is set, its value will override the one specified in the
///     @bbref{bmqt::SessionOptions}.
///
/// A @bbref{bmqa::Session} object is created in an unconnected state.  The
/// `start` or `startAsync` method must be called to connect to the broker.
/// Note that `start` method is blocking, and returns either after connection
/// to broker has been established (success), or after specified timeout
/// (failure).  `startAsync` method, as the name suggests, connects to the
/// broker asynchronously (i.e., it returns immediately), and the result of the
/// operation is notified via @bbref{bmqt::SessionEventType::e_CONNECTED}
/// session event.
///
/// When the @bbref{bmqa::Session} is no longer needed, the application should
/// call the `stop` (blocking) or `stopAsync` (non-blocking) method to shut
/// down the @bbref{bmqa::Session} and disconnect from the broker.  Note that
/// destroying a Session automatically stops it.  The session can be restarted
/// with a call to `start` or `startAsync` once it has been fully stopped.
///
/// Connection loss and reconnection               {#bmqa_session_reconnection}
/// ================================
///
/// If the connection between the application and the broker is lost, the
/// @bbref{bmqa::Session} will automatically try to reconnect periodically.
/// The @bbref{bmqa::Session} will also notify the application of the event of
/// losing the connection via @bbref{bmqt::SessionEventType::e_CONNECTION_LOST}
/// session event.
///
/// Once the connection has been re-established with the broker (as a result of
/// one of the periodic reconnection attempts), the @bbref{bmqa::Session} will
/// notify the application via @bbref{bmqt::SessionEventType::e_RECONNECTED}
/// session event.  After the connection re-establishment, the
/// @bbref{bmqa::Session} will attempt to reopen the queues that were in `OPEN`
/// state prior to connection loss.  The @bbref{bmqa::Session} will notify the
/// application of the result of reopen operation via
/// @bbref{bmqt::SessionEventType::e_QUEUE_REOPEN_RESULT} for each queue.  Note
/// that a reopen operation on a queue may fail (due to broker issue, machine
/// issue, etc), so the application must keep track on these session events,
/// and stop posting on a queue that failed to reopen.
///
/// After all reopen operations are complete and application has been notified
/// with all @bbref{bmqt::SessionEventType::e_QUEUE_REOPEN_RESULT} events, the
/// @bbref{bmqa::Session} delivers a
/// @bbref{bmqt::SessionEventType::e_STATE_RESTORED} session event to the
/// application.
///
/// Example 1                                               {#bmqa_session_ex1}
/// ---------
///
/// The following example illustrates how to create a @bbref{bmqa::Session} in
/// synchronous mode, start it, and stop it.
///
/// ```
/// void runSession()
/// {
///     bmqt::SessionOptions options;
///     options.setBrokerUri("tcp://localhost:30114");
///
///     bmqa::Session session(options);
///     int res = session.start();
///     if (0 != res) {
///         bsl::cout << "Failed to start session (" << res << ")"
///                   << bsl::endl;
///         return;
///     }
///     bsl::cout << "Session started." << bsl::endl;
///
///     // Open queue in READ or WRITE or READ/WRITE mode, and receive or
///     // post messages, etc.
///     // ...
///
///     session.stop();
/// }
/// ```
///
/// This example can be simplified because the constructor for
/// @bbref{bmqa::Session} uses a default @bbref{bmqt::SessionOptions} object
/// that will connect to the local broker service.  The example may be
/// rewritten as follow:
///
/// ```
/// void runSession()
/// {
///     bmqa::Session session;     // using default 'SessionOptions'
///     int res = session.start();
///     if (0 != res) {
///         bsl::cout << "Failed to start session (" << res << ")"
///                   << bsl::endl;
///         return;
///     }
///     bsl::cout << "Session started." << bsl::endl;
///
///     // Open queue in READ or WRITE or READ/WRITE mode, and receive or
///     // post messages, etc.
///     // ...
///
///     session.stop();
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Processing session events - synchronous mode    {#bmqa_session_synchronous}
/// ============================================
///
/// If the @bbref{bmqa::Session} is created in synchronous mode, the
/// application needs to call the `nextEvent` method on a regular basis in
/// order to receive events.  This method takes an optional wait timeout as a
/// parameter, and it will return the next available @bbref{bmqa::Event} from
/// the session's internal event queue or it will block the calling thread
/// execution until new @bbref{bmqa::Event} arrives or until the specified
/// timeout expires.  It is safe to call the `nextEvent` method from different
/// threads simultaneously: the @bbref{bmqa::Session} class provides proper
/// synchronization logic to protect the internal event queue from corruption
/// in this scenario.
///
/// Example 2                                               {#bmqa_session_ex2}
/// ---------
///
/// The following example demonstrates how to write a function that queries and
/// processes events synchronously.  In this example the switch form checks the
/// type of the @bbref{bmqa::Event} and performs the necessary actions.
///
/// We first define two functions to process @bbref{bmqa::SessionEvent} and
/// @bbref{bmqa::MessageEvent}.  These functions return `true` if we should
/// keep processing events and `false` otherwise (i.e., no more events are
/// expected from the @bbref{bmqa::Session}).

/// Opening queues                                      {#bmqa_session_opening}
/// ==============
///
/// Once the @bbref{bmqa::Session} has been created and started, the
/// application can use it to open queues for producing and/or consuming
/// messages.  A queue is associated with a domain.  Domain metadata must be
/// deployed in the BlazingMQ infrastructure prior to opening queues under that
/// domain, because opening a queue actually loads the metadata deployed for
/// the associated domain.
///
/// The metadata associated with a domain defines various parameters like
/// maximum queue size and capacity, persistent policy, routing policy, etc.
///
/// Queue are identified by URIs (Unified Resource Identifiers) that must
/// follow the BlazingMQ syntax, manipulated as @bbref{bmqt::Uri} objects.  A
/// queue URI is typically formatted as follows:
///
/// ```
///  bmq://my.domain/my.queue
/// ```
///
/// Note that domain names are unique in BlazingMQ infrastructure, which makes
/// a fully qualified queue URI unique too.
///
/// Queues in BlazingMQ infrastructure are created by applications on demand.
/// Broke creates a queue when it receives an open-queue request from an
/// application for a queue that does not exist currently.
///
/// Application can open a queue by calling `openQueue` or `openQueueAsync`
/// method on a started session.  Application must pass appropriate flags to

///
/// Note that `openQueue` is a blocking method, and returns after specified
