//@PURPOSE: Provide a pluggable functional interface to system clocks.
//
//@CLASSES:
//   bmqsys::Time: namespace for pluggable interface to system clocks
//
//@DESCRIPTION: This component provides a 'struct', 'bmqsys::Time', in which
// are defined a series of static methods for retrieving the current system
// time from the currently installed mechanism.  This component provides access
// to monotonic clock, real-time (wall) clock and a high resolution timer.  The
// mechanism to retrieve system clock and the timer can be overridden, which is
// useful while testing components which rely on system clock or timer.
