#ifndef INCLUDED_MQBNET_TRANSPORTMANAGER
#define INCLUDED_MQBNET_TRANSPORTMANAGER

//@PURPOSE: Provide a manager for all transport interfaces and clusters.
//
//@CLASSES:
//  mqbnet::TransportManager: Manager for all transport interfaces and clusters
//  mqbnet::TransportManagerIterator: Mechanism to iterate over sessions
//
//@DESCRIPTION: 'mqbnet::TransportManager' provides a mechanism to manage all
// network interfaces as well as clusters of nodes of abstracted transport
// protocol and individual outgoing connections.
// 'mqbnet::TransportManagerIterator' provides thread safe iteration through
// all the sessions of a transport manager.  The order of the iteration is
// implementation defined.  Thread safe iteration is provided by locking the
// transport manager during the iterator's construction and unlocking it at the
// iterator's destruction.  This guarantees that during the life time of an
// iterator, the manager can't be modified.
//
// CONNECTIONS
//-----------
// TransportManager handles 3 kind of connections, all related to clusters:
//: o inter-cluster connections: connections between peer nodes within a same
//:   cluster
//: o proxy-cluster connections: connections from a 'proxy' broker to the nodes
//:   composing a cluster
//: o reversed connections: outgoing connections established from this node to
//:   a remote peer, typically used to go around connectivity restrictions
//:   (firewall) and allow that remote peer to use this connection channel as a
//:   proxy-cluster communication.
//
/// CLUSTER
///-------
// There are two kinds of cluster at the application layer:
//: o a cluster for which the broker is member of, aka 'Cluster'
//: o a cluster for a broker not being part of the cluster, aka 'ProxyCluster'
// A single class, 'mqbnet::Cluster', is used to represent both types.
// However, their creation is slightly different: in the case of a
// 'ProxyCluster', a connection is established from this broker to each node
// composing the 'Cluster', because effectively, only this broker cares about
// those connections - the 'real cluster' isn't aware of proxies, and as far as
// it is concerned, this broker will just appear as a regular client connected
// to it.  On the other hand, for the 'Cluster' clusters, each broker needs a
// full mesh of connectivity with all other nodes composing the cluster.  In
// order to not have two connections between each node, connections are
// established only from a node having a lower node Id to a node having a
// higher node Id.
