# Suppress sporadically appearing data race in bmqimp::Brokersession test driver.
# In TestSession::arriveAtStepWithCfgs() there is a call of queue->setOptions() method,
# at nearly same time in other thread bmqimp::BrokerSession::onConfigureQueueResponse() calls
# queue->options().suspendsOnBadHostHealth() method which is detected as data race.
# bmqt::QueueOptions and bmqimp::Queue classes are not thread safe by design,
# and bmqimp::BrokerSession::onConfigureQueueResponse() cllback access them in
# not thread-safe manner, probably also by design, assuming that it will be called again
# if something is changed. Further investigation is required, suppress it for now.

# Since we use mqbmock::Dispatcher in unit tests, this method does not get
# enqueued correctly back to cluster-dispatcher thread, causing potential
# data race.
