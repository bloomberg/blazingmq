# bmqp::Crc32c carries out misaligned access of Int64 in one of the internal
# routines, but only on x86/64.  Misaligned accesses are handled gracefully by
# this hardware, unlike SPARC.  So we simply suppress this warning.  Other
# option is to update the code, which can be done by someone feeling
# adventurous.
