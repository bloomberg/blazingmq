        BlazingMQ is a distributed message queueing platform with focus on
        efficiency, reliability and a rich feature set for modern day
        workflows.
      </p>
      <p>
        Carefully architected and written in C++ from the ground up with no
        dependency on any external distributed framework (e.g., Apache
        ZooKeeper), BlazingMQ provides consistently low median and p99 latency.
      </p>
      <p>
        With its unique multi-hop network topology, BlazingMQ can lead to
        significant savings in network bandwidth and latency for high fan-out
        workflows.
